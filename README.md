# NSPW
Cool update of SPW
[Read Code Plz,idk why the preview messed up]
# How do I use it?
Aim to a prop,then type "savee_nspw_debug_pickup" in game console to pickup a prop(or dupe)
that's it
# Convars?
Too many convars,I'm too lazy to explain them,just type savee_nspw_ in game console
# Controls?
LMB: Attack/Fire
RMB: Block/Alt fire(there's no altfire in current version,sad)
R: Reload(Gun)
E+R Select "Style"(HoldType)
E+RMB: Drop props
Heavy Shotguns and Bolt-Action Rifles require press LMB manually to pump/bolt

# Gun Support?
CS:S Weapons,HL2 firearms(not crossbow or rpg,lol)(not including 357,sad)

# Anything required?
Actually,NOTHING but your brain,be creative plz
(it would be better if you use AdvDupe2+Multi-Parent Tool+Prop Resizer+Wiremod)

# Support [Insert things here]?
NPC - Probably
Nextbot - NO
Zeta/Lambda Players - No,but I'll try

# Credits
